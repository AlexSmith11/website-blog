## Personal website

This is the repo for my personal website. This is a work in progress.<br />
It was created with CRA and uses Netlify and its continous deployment feature for production builds and hosting.<br />
The purpose of this site is to help me expand my knowledge of front-end development through different, smaller projects.<br />
These include setting up:<br />

- GitHub table of repos
- Blog
- CV page
- Photo gallery

An emphasis will be placed on making these features visually/aesthetically good looking/pleasing.<br />
Designs for each page will be done by hand and then via Figma.<br />

Quick design notes:<br />
There are multiple css files because I'm 1: a noob with css and 2: wanting to have v different looks on various pages (one will be a photo gallery, another a github table) so keeping them seperate is easier. Afterwards, redundant css will be removed.

#This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
